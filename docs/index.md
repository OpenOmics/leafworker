## Overview

Welcome to leafworker's documentation! This guide is the main source of documentation for users that are getting started with the [leafworker pipeline](https://github.com/OpenOmics/leafworker/). This pipeline is a wrapper around the [leafcutter<sup>0</sup>](https://github.com/davidaknowles/leafcutter/tree/master), a tool for the analysis of RNA-seq data to identify and quantify alternative splicing events. The pipeline is designed to be highly scalable, reproducible, and easy to use. If you use this pipeline, _please do not forget to cite [leafcutter](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-017-0004-9)_.

The **`./leafworker`** pipeline is composed several inter-related sub commands to setup and run the pipeline across different systems. Each of the available sub commands perform different functions: 

<section align="center" markdown="1" style="display: flex; flex-wrap: row wrap; justify-content: space-around;">

!!! inline custom-grid-button ""

    [<code style="font-size: 1em;">leafworker <b>run</b></code>](usage/run.md)   
    Run the leafworker pipeline with your input files.

!!! inline custom-grid-button ""

    [<code style="font-size: 1em;">leafworker <b>unlock</b></code>](usage/unlock.md)  
    Unlocks a previous runs output directory.

!!! inline custom-grid-button ""

    [<code style="font-size: 1em;">leafworker <b>install</b></code>](usage/install.md)  
    Download remote reference files locally.

    [<code style="font-size: 1em;">leafworker <b>cache</b></code>](usage/cache.md)  
    Cache remote software containers locally.

**leafworker** is a pipeline to make running leafcutter easier, more reproducible, and more scalable. It relies on technologies like [Singularity<sup>1</sup>](https://singularity.lbl.gov/) to maintain the highest-level of reproducibility. The pipeline consists of a series of data processing and quality-control steps orchestrated by [Snakemake<sup>2</sup>](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a flexible and scalable workflow management system, to submit jobs to a cluster.

The pipeline is compatible with data generated from Illumina short-read sequencing technologies. As input, it accepts a set of BAM files and can be run locally on a compute instance or on-premise using a cluster. A user can define the method or mode of execution. The pipeline can submit jobs to a cluster using a job scheduler like SLURM (more coming soon!). A hybrid approach ensures the pipeline is accessible to all users.

Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through the [usage](usage/run.md) section of each available sub command.
